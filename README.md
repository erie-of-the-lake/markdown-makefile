# PDF Makefile

This Makefile is for transforming Markdown files into different documents, most often PDFs. For PDFs particularly, the Makefile defaults to using the [Eisvogel pandoc LaTeX template](https://github.com/enhuiz/eisvogel).

In addition, using pandoc, the Makefile can also convert back and forth betwee Markdown and several other formats like *docx*, *epub*, *html*, *odt*, and *txt*, though some conversions may be lossy.
